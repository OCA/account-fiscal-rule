# Fiscal Rules (multi-criteria decision tables)

With its fiscal position mapping, Odoo may have a limited ability to apply the proper taxes and mapping depending on the context, for instance country of origin and destination of the goods and this could put the fiscal burden on the salesperson, not to speak about e-commerce where things should be automatic. This extensible framework makes it possible to select the proper fiscal position to apply according to an extensible flat decision table.
