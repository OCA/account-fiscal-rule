Fiscal Rules (multi-criteria decision tables)
=============================================

with its fiscal position mapping, OpenERP / Odoo may have a limited
ability to apply the proper taxes and mapping depending on the
context, for instance country of origin and destination of the goods
and this could put the fiscal burden on the salesperson, not to speak
about e-commerce where things should be automatic. This extensible
framework makes it possible to select the proper fiscal position to
apply according to an extensible flat decision table.

Additionally, account_product_fiscal_classification enable to select
default product sale and purchase taxes based on a tax class.
