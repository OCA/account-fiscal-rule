Usually taxes on customer invocies are collected from the customer,
to then be paid to the tax authorities. They are not a business expense.

Some business scenarios require to compute taxes that are not
collected from the customer, but are still required to be paid.
Unlike regular sales taxes, this kind if taxes is an expense to the seller.

The tax amount must be recorded separately, and not added to the
Invoice subtotals and totals.
At the accounting level, the tax is an expense supported by the company,
and is not included in the customer account receivable.

A use case is allowing to compute US Use Tax on Customer Invoices,
instead of regular US Sales Tax, for situations where this is allowed.
