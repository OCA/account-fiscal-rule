  I create a fiscal position
-
  !record {model: account.fiscal.position, id: fiscal_position_test_invoice}:
    name: Internal sale invoice
    company_id: base.main_company
-
  I create a partner to sale
-
  !record {model: res.partner, id: res_partner_test}:
    name: Danimar
    company_id: base.main_company
-
  Now I create a account fiscal rule to set the correct fiscal position
-
  !record {model: account.fiscal.position.rule, id: account_fiscal_position_rule_test_invoice}:
    name: General Rule
    fiscal_position_id: account_fiscal_position_rule_stock.fiscal_position_test_invoice
    company_id: base.main_company
    use_picking: True 
    sequence: 5
-
  I create a picking with the partner
-
  !record {model: stock.picking, id: stock_picking_test_invoice}:
    partner_id: account_fiscal_position_rule_stock.res_partner_test
    picking_type_id: stock.picking_type_in
    move_lines:
      - product_id: product.product_product_8
        product_uom_qty: 16
        location_id: stock.stock_location_suppliers
        location_dest_id: stock.stock_location_stock

  Create invoice from picking and assert the fiscal position
-
  !python {model: stock.picking}: |
    journal_obj = self.pool.get('account.journal')
    invoice_obj = self.pool.get('account.invoice')
    picking = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("stock_picking_test_invoice"))
    picking.action_confirm()
    picking.do_transfer()
    assert picking.state == 'done', "Picking state should be done"
    # The posibility to generate a invoice from picking were removed in version 9.0
    # but it's important feature in some cases and for brazilian localization,
    # by this reason i think will need to make a solution for this problem
    #invoice_ids = picking.action_invoice_create(
    #      journal_id = journal_obj.search(cr, uid, [('type', '=', 'purchase')])[0],
    #      group = False,
    #      type = 'in_invoice')
    #for invoice in invoice_obj.browse(cr, uid, invoice_ids, context=context):
    #    assert invoice.fiscal_position.id == ref('account_fiscal_position_rule_stock.fiscal_position_test_invoice'), 'Fiscal position in invoice not set correctly'
