This module extends the Odoo Account module to introduce Fiscal Classifications.

A fiscal classification is an association of purchase and sale taxes that
have to be set on your products.

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/account-fiscal-rule/16.0/account_product_fiscal_classification/static/description/product_template_form.png

This new design provides the following improvments.

* It is more simple (less clicks quantity) to configure correctly a product.
  (You only have to set a fiscal classification, instead of setting one or many
  sale taxes, then click on purchase tab and set one or many purchase taxes.)

* Prevent users to select incompatible purchase and sale taxes.
  French Exemple: A product can not be configured with:

  * Purchase Taxes: 5.5%
  * Sale Taxes: 20%

* Optionaly, you can restrict the usage of some fiscal classifications to
  some product categories.
  French Exemple : A product set in the category "Beer and wine" can not
  have a sale tax 5,5%. (20% is mandatory)

Configuration
=============

* Go to "Accounting > Configuration > Accounting > Fiscal Classifications".

* Create new classification, with correct purchase and sale taxes.

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/account-fiscal-rule/16.0/account_product_fiscal_classification/static/description/fiscal_classification_form.png

**Note**

When installing the module, it will create fiscal classifications for all
the taxes combinations that exist in your database.
If some are bad, you can massively move the products for a bad classification
to the good one, using the button "Move products into another fiscal classification".

**Optional settings**

Once the fiscal classifications are created, you can create rules to avoid
users to use some classifications that don't make sense for some categories.

* Go to "Accounting > Configuration > Accounting > Fiscal Classification Rules"
* Create new rules.

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/account-fiscal-rule/16.0/account_product_fiscal_classification/static/description/fiscal_classification_rule__wine.png

Every time a new product is created, the rules that matches the product setting will
be checked **in the displayed order**.

* If one rule is set to 'Allow', the next rules are ignored.
* If one rule is set to 'Forbid', an error is raised.
