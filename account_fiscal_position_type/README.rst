Simplify taxes management for products
======================================

Functionality:
--------------
* Add a new light concept 'fiscal_classification' to associate possible
  purchase and sale taxes;

* Make more usable taxes selection in product view. The user has now the
  possibility to select a fiscal classification, instead of select manually
  all the taxes;

* Prevent users to select incompatible purchase and sale taxes.
  French Exemple: A product can not be configured with:

  * Purchase Taxes: 5.5 %;
  * Sale Taxes: 20%;

* Provides the possibility to the account manager to change incorrect
  parameters massively;

Technical Information:
----------------------
* Install this module will create 'fiscal_classification' for each existing
  combination. Make sure that the user who install the module is
  SUPERUSER_ID or is member of account.group_account_manager;
* In the same way, import products will create fiscal_classification if
  combination doesn't exist and will fail if right access is not sufficient.
  A solution is to provide fiscal_classification_id during the import,
  instead of Providing taxes_id and purchase_taxes_id fields;
