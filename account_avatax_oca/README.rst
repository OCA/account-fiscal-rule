Odoo provides integration with AvaTax, a tax solution software by
Avalara which includes sales tax calculation for all US states and
territories and all Canadian provinces and territories (including GST,
PST, and HST).

This module is capable of automatically detecting origin (Output
Warehouse) and destination (Client Address), then calculating and
reporting taxes to the user's Avalara account as well as a recording the
correct sales taxes for the validated addresses within Odoo ERP.

This module is compatible both with the Odoo Enterprise and Odoo
Community editions.

An Avatax account is needed. Account information to access the Avatax
dashboard can be obtained through the Avalara website here:
https://www.avalara.com/products/calculations.html

Once configured, the module operates in the background and performs
calculations and reporting seamlessly to the AvaTax server.

This guide includes instructions for the following elements:

-  Activating your organization's AvaTax account and downloading the
   product
-  Entering the AvaTax credentials into your Odoo database and
   configuring it to use AvaTax services and features within Odoo

Note: Test the module before deploying in live environment. All changes
to the AvaTax settings must be performed by a user with administrative
access rights.

**IMPORTANT - resolving name conflict with Odoo EE**

Avatax support was added to Odoo EE 14 and 15. Unfortunately the module
names used are the same as the OCA ones, and because of this name
collision the OCA modules were forced to change name.

The main module was renamed from ``account_avatax`` (now used by Odoo
EE) to ``account_avatax_oca``.

To apply this change in your odoo database and continue using the OCA
Avalara certified connector:

   1. | Ensure you have the latest version from the OCA, and you see
        ``account_avatax_oca``
      | in your Apps list.

   2. Install the new ``account_avatax_oca`` module

   3. Unistall the ``account_avatax`` module

   4. | Confirm that your configurations were kept safe, in particular:
      | Avatax API, "Avatax" default Fiscal Position, and "Avatax"
        default Tax record.

Fiscal Positions is what tells the AvaTax connector if the AvaTax
service should be used for a particular Sales Order or Invoice.

Configure Fiscal Position:

-  Navigate to: Accounting/Invoicing App >> Configuration >> Accounting
   >> Fiscal Positions
-  Ensure there is a Fiscal Position record for the Company, with the
   "Use Avatax API" flag checked

When the appropriate Fiscal Position is being used, and a tax rate is
retrieved form AvaTax, then the corresponding Tax is automatically
created in Odoo using a template tax record, that should have the
appropriate accounting configurations.

Usage
=====

Customer Invoices
-----------------

The AvaTax module is integrated into Sales Invoices and is applied to
each transaction. The transaction log in the AvaTax dashboard shows the
invoice details and displays whether the transaction is in an
uncommitted or committed status.

A validated invoice will have a Committed status and a cancelled invoice
will have a Voided status.

The module will check if there is a selected warehouse and will
automatically determine the address of the warehouse and the origin
location. If no address is assigned to the warehouse, the company
address is used.

Discounts are handled when they are enabled in Odoo's settings. They are
calculated as a net deduction on the line item cost before the total is
sent to AvaTax.

Create New Customer Invoice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Navigate to: Accounting or Invoicing >> Customers >> Invoices.
-  Click Create button.

Validate Invoice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Ensure that Tax based on shipping address is checked.
-  Line items should have AVATAX selected under Taxes for internal
   records.
-  To complete the invoice, click the Validate button.
-  The sale order will now appear in the AvaTax dashboard.

Register Payment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Click the Register Payment button to finalize the invoice.

Customer Refunds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Odoo applies refunds as opposed to voids in its accounting module. As
with customer invoices, the AvaTax module is integrated with customer
refunds and is applied to each transaction.

| Refunded invoice transactions will be indicated
| with a negative total in the AvaTax interface.

Initiate Customer Refund

-  Navigate to: Accounting or Invoicing >> Customers >> Invoices
-  Select the invoice you wish to refund
-  Click Add Credit Note button

Create Credit Note

-  Under Credit Method, select Create a draft credit note.
-  Enter a reason.
-  Click Add Credit Note button.

Note: You will be taken to the Credit Notes list view

Validate Refund

-  Select the Credit Note you wish to validate, review and then click
   Validate button.

Register Refund Payment

-  Click Register Payment button to complete a refund

Sales Orders
------------

The AvaTax module is integrated into Sales Orders and allows computation
of taxes. Sales order transactions do not appear in the in the AvaTax
interface.

| The information placed in the sales order will automatically pass to
  the invoice
| on the Avalara server and can be viewed in the AvaTax control panel.

Discounts are handled when they are enabled in Odoo's settings. They
will be reported as a net deduction on the line item cost.

Create New Sales Order

-  Navigate to: Sales >> Orders >> Orders
-  Click Create button

Compute Taxes with AvaTax

-  The module will calculate tax when the sales order is confirmed, or
   by navigating to Action >> Update taxes with Avatax. At this step,
   the sales order will retrieve the tax amount from Avalara but will
   not report the transaction to the AvaTax dashboard. Only invoice,
   refund, and payment activity are reported to the dashboard.
-  The module will check if there is a selected warehouse and will
   automatically determine the address of the warehouse and the origin
   location. If no address is assigned to the warehouse the module will
   automatically use the address of the company as its origin. Location
   code will automatically populate with the warehouse code but can be
   modified if needed.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

The development of this module was driven by US companies to compute
Sales Tax.

However the Avatax service supports more use cases, that could be added:

-  Add support to EU VAT
-  Add support to US Use Tax on Purchases / vendor Bills

Other improvements that could be added:

-  Detect and warn if customers State is not a nexus available for the
   current account

Other credits
-------------

This module was originally developed by Fabrice Henrion at Odoo SA, and
maintained up to version 11.

For version 12, Fabrice invited partners to migrate this modules to
later version, and maintain it.

Open Source Integrators performed the migration to Odoo 12 , and later
added support for the more up to date REST API , alongside with the
legacy SOAP API.

With the addition of the REST API, a deep refactor was introduced,
changing the tax calculation approach, from just setting the total tax
amount, to instead adding the tax rates to each document line and then
having Odoo do all the other computations.

For Odoo 13, the legacy SOAP support was supported, and additional
refactoring was done to contribute the module to the Odoo Community
Association.
