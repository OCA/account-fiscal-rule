The development of this module was driven by US companies to compute Sales Tax.

However the Avatax service supports more use cases, that could be added:

- Add support to EU VAT
- Add support to US Use Tax on Purchases / vendor Bills

Other improvements that could be added:

- Detect and warn if customers State is not a nexus available for the current account
