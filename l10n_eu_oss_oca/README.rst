Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Settings > Taxes*.
#. You can see that user can choose *Add new taxes* for applying EU taxes regarding OSS.
#. Select the company where you want to add these new taxes.
#. Select the EU countries where you can send your goods.
#. Select if you want these new taxes to be configured as included in price.
#. Select the general, reduced, super reduced and second super reduced taxes according your accounting plan.
#. Remember that you shouldn't configure unexisting taxes for your accounting plan.
#. Click *Create Fiscal Positions and Taxes* button to continue.
#. According your configuration, new taxes and fiscal positions will be created.

**NOTE**: You should use account_fiscal_position_partner_type module configuration for making the workflow easier.

Usage
=====

After the corresponding configuration of this module:

#. Create a new partner and assign an EU country (different from the one set in your company).
#. Check that this new partner has been configured as a *Customer* in *Fiscal Position Type* field.
#. Create a new product and set its taxes.
#. Create a new Quotation for the customer and add the new product in a sale order line.
#. User will see that taxes will be set according the delivery address country taxation.
#. You can create directly an invoice without starting from a SO and the pertinent taxes will be applied as well.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

#. This module doesn't take into account if one or more products
   have different type of taxes in the destination contry.

#. There are some countries (for example Cyprus) that have
   uncommon reduced taxes, depending on the typology of the sold product.
   In Cyprus, it happens with *Supply of goods and services
   of a kind normally intended for use in agricultural production
   but excluding capital goods such as machinery or buildings*
   where an 8% of VAT has to be applied instead of the common reduced type.
   These use cases haven't been considered.
