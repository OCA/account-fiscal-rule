#. This module doesn't take into account if one or more products
   have different type of taxes in the destination contry.

#. There are some countries (for example Cyprus) that have
   uncommon reduced taxes, depending on the typology of the sold product.
   In Cyprus, it happens with *Supply of goods and services
   of a kind normally intended for use in agricultural production
   but excluding capital goods such as machinery or buildings*
   where an 8% of VAT has to be applied instead of the common reduced type.
   These use cases haven't been considered.
