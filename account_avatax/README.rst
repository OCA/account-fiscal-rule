Odoo provides integration with AvaTax, a tax solution software by Avalara
which includes sales tax calculation for all US states and territories
and all Canadian provinces and territories (including GST, PST, and HST).

This module is capable of automatically detecting origin (Output Warehouse)
and destination (Client Address), then calculating and reporting taxes
to the user's Avalara account as well as a recording the correct sales taxes
for the validated addresses within Odoo ERP.

This module is compatible both with the Odoo Enterprise and odoo Community
editions.

An Avatax account is needed. Account information to access
the Avatax dashboard can be obtained through the Avalara website here:
https://www.avalara.com/products/avatax/

Once configured, the module operates in the background and performs
calculations and reporting seamlessly to the AvaTax server.

This guide includes instructions for the following elements:

- Activating your organization's AvaTax account and downloading the product
- Entering the AvaTax credentials into your Odoo database and configuring it
  to use AvaTax services and features within Odoo

Note: Test the module before deploying in live environment.
All changes to the AvaTax settings must be performed by a user with
administrative access rights.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Usage

and is applied to each transaction.
The transaction log in the AvaTax dashboard shows the invoice details
and displays whether the transaction is in an uncommitted or committed status.

A validated invoice will have a Committed status
and a cancelled invoice will have a Voided status.

The module will check if there is a selected warehouse
and will automatically determine the address of the warehouse
and the origin location.
If no address is assigned to the warehouse, the company address is used.

Discounts are handled when they are enabled in Odoo's settings.
They are calculated as a net deduction on the line item cost
before the total is sent to AvaTax.

Create New Customer Invoice

- Navigate to: Accounting or Invoicing >> Customers >> Invoices.
- Click Create button.

Validate Invoice
++++++++++++++++

Customer Refunds

 with a negative total in the AvaTax interface.

Sales Orders

The AvaTax module is integrated into Sales Orders and allows computation of taxes.
Sales order transactions do not appear in the in the AvaTax interface.

Discounts are handled when they are enabled in Odoo's settings.
They will be reported as a net deduction on the line item cost.

Create New Sales Order

- Navigate to: Sales >> Orders >> Orders
- Click Create button

Compute Taxes with AvaTax

- The module will calculate tax when the sales order is confirmed,
  or by navigating to Action >> Update taxes with Avatax.
  At this step, the sales order will retrieve the tax amount from Avalara
  but will not report the transaction to the AvaTax dashboard.
  Only invoice, refund, and payment activity are reported to the dashboard.
- The module will check if there is a selected warehouse
  and will automatically determine the address of the warehouse
  and the origin location. If no address is assigned to the warehouse
  the module will automatically use the address of the company as its origin.
  Location code will automatically populate with the warehouse code
  but can be modified if needed.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

The development of this module was driven by US companies to compute Sales Tax.

However the Avatax service supports more use cases, that could be added:

- Add support to EU VAT
- Add support to US Use Tax on Purchases / vendor Bills

Other improvements that could be added:

- Detect and warn if customers State is not a nexus available for the current account

This module was originally developed by Fabrice Henrion at Odoo SA,
and maintained up to version 11.

For version 12, Fabrice invited partners to migrate this modules to
later version, and maintain it.

Open Source Integrators performed the migration to Odoo 12
, and later added support for the more up to date REST API
, alongside with the legacy SOAP API.

With the addition of the REST API, a deep refactor was introduced,
changing the tax calculation approach, from just setting the total
tax amount, to instead adding the tax rates to each document line
and then having Odoo do all the other computations.

For Odoo 13, the legacy SOAP support was supported, and
additional refactoring was done to contribute the module
to the Odoo Community Association.
