This module was originally developed by Fabrice Henrion at Odoo SA,
and maintained up to version 11.

For version 12, Fabrice invited partners to migrate this modules to
later version, and maintain it.

Open Source Integrators performed the migration to Odoo 12
, and later added support for the more up to date REST API
, alongside with the legacy SOAP API.

With the addition of the REST API, a deep refactor was introduced,
changing the tax calculation approach, from just setting the total
tax amount, to instead adding the tax rates to each document line
and then having Odoo do all the other computations.

For Odoo 13, the legacy SOAP support was supported, and
additional refactoring was done to contribute the module
to the Odoo Community Association.
