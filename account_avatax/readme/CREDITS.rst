This module was originally developed by Frabrice Henrion at Odoo SA.

Upon release od Odoo 12, Fabrice and Odoo SA stopped supporting the module,
and invited Odoo partners to maintain it.

Open Source Integrators decided to contribute the module to the OCA,
on the Odoo 13 refactoring.

For previous Odoo versions, from Odoo 9 to Odoo 12, the code is
maintained at https://github.com/sodexis/avatax_connector.
